**ARCHIVED**: this is now available within the Sooner Rover Team's [`auto_ros2` repo](https://github.com/Sooner-Rover-Team/auto_ros2/tree/1798c6f06cbf9301d7b2a49b6c6364e4cff91268/lib/feedback) 

# feedback

This is a cross-platform library intended to deserialize the Rover's various message types into their raw bytes for external usage.

## Usage

`feedback` is compatible with native Rust, alongside Python using PyO3.

### Rust

To use this library in Rust, simply import it with `use feedback;`.

### Python

To get it into a Python project, there are a few steps:

1. Install `maturin` using the instructions [in their README](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin).
1. Build the crate into a Python wheel with `maturin build`. It should go to `feedback/target/wheels/wheels-(a bunch of stuff).whl`.
1. You can either [put that onto PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyo3-pack/) and install it from Rye, or use the built artifact directly. Let's assume you're using the artifact!
1. Run this command. Make sure to replace the path with a correct one: `rye add feedback --path "../target/wheels/feedback-0.1.0-cp311-cp311-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl"`.
1. Type `rye sync` into your terminal and use it in your project with: `import feedback`.
1. All done!

## Development

When making changes on the Rust side, you can easily write doctests and unit tests for your testing needs. However, Python is generally used with the `maturin develop` command. Give it a try!

Here are some resources for Rust and PyO3 in general:

- [The PyO3 Book](https://pyo3.rs/) - a good source of info for writing Python... with Rust!
- [The Rust Programming Language (book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/foreword.html) - A Rust user's main reference. It explains all significant parts of the language in detail.
- [`std` Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html) - The Rust standard library documentation. All parts of the language are fully documented, so it's easy to find some examples and help.
